This repository contains the scripts of one of my university's course, 'Modellazione Solida Navale' (Solid Modelling focusing on the naval field).
There will be Matlab scripts that allow to export illustrative hull's data to other softwares like Rhinoceros, and also some data processing to compare softwares' response with the numerical way.
